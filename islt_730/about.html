        <h3>This is a webpage about me</h3>
        <p>Hello my name is <em>Nathan Patterson</em> and I am a Senior studying <b>Information Technology</b>. <br> 
            During my time here I have learned a lot of different subjects including VR, Web Design, Game Design, software development, and project management skills. <br>
            I have really enjoyed learning all of these concepts because technology is my passion and being able to help others through technology is a very rewarding feeling. More about me is that I am involved on campus. I am in Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity, I am an engineering school ambassador, and I work on campus for Adroit studios as a game developer/designer. Being a part of those organizations has made my campus experience much better. Overall I'm excited to take this class and meet new people that are also trying to refine their technology skills and want to explore how technology can help you in your life as well as others.</p>
        
            <p>My education has been a Bachelors degree for Information Technology from the University of Missouri. I will graduate with a bachelors degree.</p>
