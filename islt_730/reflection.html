    <p style="color:blue;">Hello
    <span style="color:black;"> my name is Nathan Patterson and I am a Senior studying Information Technology. During my time here I have learned a lot of different subjects including VR, Web Design, Game Design, software development, and project management skills. I have really enjoyed learning all of these concepts because technology is my passion and being able to help others through technology is a very rewarding feeling. More about me is that I am involved on campus. I am in Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity, I am an engineering school ambassador, and I work on campus for Adroit studios as a game developer/designer. Being a part of those organizations has made my campus experience much better. Overall I'm excited to take this class and meet new people that are also trying to refine their technology skills and want to explore how technology can help you in your life as well as others.

    <p style="text-indent: 30%">My job that I have currently is as a game designer and game developer. For this role I feel like I'm making a very positive impact in the world. This is because of the game studio that I work for on campus. In our studio we make educational games that have a positive impact on the world. One of the games is called mission hydrosci. This game is made to replace a week's worth of science curriculum turned into a web game that students can play. In this game students learn through doing and not by someone talking to them giving them content to understand. The work that I have done so far for this project is mostly 3D modeling. This comprises sketching, modeling, and rendering assets that will be put in the game. Assets are the objects that you see in a video game. Some assets that I have worked on are trees, scrap metal, electric components, rocks, chests, and other things you could find in a natural environment. Now I am working on UI work. UI is called a user interface. My job for this is to design a pause menu that the players can use to navigate different components of the game. This is a skill that is very helpful to learn because there are lots of jobs for UI designers because most applications and websites use some form of a user interface. This is important because the UI needs to be simple and straight to the point so the user has an easy and intuitive time using the interface. </p>
