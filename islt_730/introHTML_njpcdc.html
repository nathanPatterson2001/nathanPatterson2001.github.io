    Hello, my name is Nathan Patterson. I am an IT major from St. Louis Missouri and I’m completing my last year here at Mizzou as a senior. Being an Information Technology student I have had experience with building websites and web applications. I have taken a class for web design that got very in-depth so if anyone needs any help with anything then I’ll probably be able to help you find a solution. My expectations of this course are being able to develop a portfolio website that will help me professionally and brush up on my skills as a programmer. With the web development skills that I learn, I hope to hope to be able to make a website that will showcase all of the work that I have done. My favorite hobby at the moment is working out. I enjoy this because I like keeping track of my progress. In my free time, I enjoy getting things done and hanging out with friends.
